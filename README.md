## Introduction
This project focuses on developing an AI-powered classification system aimed at optimizing inventory management and product organization through automated categorization. The system leverages advanced NLP and deep learning techniques to classify product metadata and user-generated title descriptions.

## Problem Statement
Manual categorization in large-scale environments is complex due to diverse product attributes and extensive inventories. It is inefficient and error-prone, necessitating an automated solution. The project addresses three major challenges:
1. Accurately classifying Amazon product metadata.
2. Categorizing user-entered titles from the Databricks dataset.
3. Managing a highly imbalanced dataset for chief-level role classification.

## Project Objectives
- Develop a high-accuracy classification model for product metadata categorization.
- Leverage NLP techniques for categorizing audience personas and chief-level roles.
- Implement a hybrid approach using LSTM, BERT, and Generative AI to handle complex scenarios.

## Datasets
- **Amazon Datasets:** Categorized under 35 categories, filtered using a defined metric to cover ~80% of total products.
- **Databricks Dataset:** Contains title descriptions with two labeling columns â€” Audience Personas and Chief-Level Roles.
- **Imbalanced Dataset for Chief-Level Roles:** Managed through undersampling, PCA, and SMOTE sampling.

## Solution Approach
### Data Preprocessing
- Lowercasing, special character removal, translation to English, and lemmatization.
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and BERT embeddings.
- PCA for dimensionality reduction and SMOTE for balancing skewed data.

### Modeling Techniques
#### Amazon Product Metadata Classification
- LSTM model trained on a balanced dataset.
- Achieved **90% test accuracy**.

#### Audience Persona Categorization
- Classified user titles from Databricks using LSTM.
- Model trained on well-distributed data.

#### Chief-Level Role Classification
- Classified titles into chief-level roles, managing extreme class imbalance.
- Introduced 'Others/Unprioritized' class.
- Applied undersampling, PCA, and SMOTE before training.
- Hybrid BERT and Generative AI model planned for improved recall.

#### Hybrid BERT and Generative AI Model
- Future implementation to enhance performance on imbalanced datasets.

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
- Classification reports and confusion matrices for detailed assessment.

## Results
- **Amazon Product Metadata:** 90% test accuracy.
- **Audience Persona Classification:** 97.5% test accuracy and 93% recall.
- **Chief-Level Roles:** 93.5% test accuracy but struggled with recall (77%); hybrid BERT + Gen AI model planned.
- K-Fold cross validation also planned for both the models after some POCs.

## Future Scope
- Real-time categorization for dynamic inventory systems.
- Integration of multi-lingual models for broader applications.
- Implement feedback loops for iterative improvements.
